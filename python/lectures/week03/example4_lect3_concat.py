#It is typical that you have a first name and a surname.
#Write a python program that prints the first name followed by the surname,
#making sure that there is a blank space between the first name and the surname.
#Your program should store the first name in a variable called firstName and the
#surname in a  variable secondName. You may use additional variables for the task


firstName = 'Glen'
surName = 'Davis'
fullName = firstName + ' ' + surName
print("This is my full name:", fullName)
