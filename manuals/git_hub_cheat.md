###Configure tooling
    Configure user information for all local repositories

- ```$ git config --global user.name "[name]"```

    Sets the name you want attached to your commit transactions

- ```$ git config --global user.email "[email address]"```

    Sets the email you want attached to your commit transactions

###Create repositories
    Start a new repository or obtain one from an existing URL

- ```$ git init [project-name]```

    Creates a new local repository with the specified name

- ```$ git clone [url]```

    Downloads a project and its entire version history

###Make changes
    Review edits and craft a commit transaction

- ```$ git status```

    Lists all new or modified files to be committed

- ```$ git diff```

    Shows file differences not yet staged

- ```$ git add [file]```

    Snapshots the file in preparation for versioning
    - ```$ git add -A```: add all untracked files at all entry
    - ```$ git reset [file]```: unstage file

- ```$ git diff --staged```

    Shows file differences between staging and the last file version

- ```$ git reset [file]```

    Unstages the file, but preserves its contents

- ```$ git commit -m"[descriptive message]"```

    Records file snapshots permanently in version history

###Group changes
    Name a series of commits and combine completed efforts

- ```$ git branch```

    Lists all local branches in the current repository

- ```$ git branch [branch-name]```

    Creates a new branch

- ```$ git checkout [branch-name]```

    Switches to the specified branch and updates working directory

- ```$ git merge [branch-name]```

    Combines the specified branchâ€™s history into the current branch

- ```$ git branch -d [branch-name]```

    Deletes the specified branch

###Refactor file names
    Relocate and remove versioned files

- ```$ git rm [file]```

    Deletes the file from the working directory and stages the deletion

- ```$ git rm --cached [file]```

    Removes the file from version control but preserves the file locally

- ```$ git mv [file-original] [file-renamed]```

    Changes the file name and prepare it for commit

###Suppress tracking
    Exclude temporary files and paths
- ```
    *.log
    build/
    temp-*
    ```
    A text file named .gitignore suppresses accidental versioning of files and paths matching the specified patterns

- ```$ git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard```

    Lists all ignored files in this project

###Save fragments
    Shelve and restore incomplete changes

- ```$ git stash```

    Temporarily stores all modified tracked files

- ```$ git stash pop```

    Restores the most recently stashed files

- ```$ git stash list```

    Lists all stashed changesets

- ```$ git stash drop```

    Discards the most recently stashed changeset

###Review history
    Browse and inspect the evolution of project files

- ```$ git log```

    Lists version history for the current branch

- ``` git log --follow [file]```

    Lists version history for the file, including renames

- ```$ git diff [first-branch]...[second-branch]```

    Shows content differences between two branches

- ```$ git show [commit]```

    Outputs metadata and content changes of the specified commit

###Redo commits
    Erase mistakes and craft replacement history

- ``` git reset [commit]```

    Undoes all commits after [commit], preserving changes locally

- ```$ git reset --hard [commit]```

    Discards all history and changes back to the specified commit

###Synchronize changes
    Register a remote (URL) and exchange repository history

- ```$ git fetch [remote]```

    Downloads all history from the remote repository

- ```$ git merge [remote]/[branch]```

    Combines the remote branch into the current local branch

- ```$ git push [remote] [branch]```

    Uploads all local branch commits to GitHub

- ```$ git pull```

    Downloads bookmark history and incorporates changes
